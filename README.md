# Eye_disease

Detecting eye diseases at an early stage is vital for effective treatment and prevention of vision loss. Image based deep learning algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to automate this process, providing accurate and efficient diagnoses. In this study, we propose some deep learning model for the detection of various eye diseases using image as input. We explore different deep learning architectures, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ResNest model, and investigate their suitability for eye disease detection task. At the end of this study, we note that Restnet model, a pretrainning model has higher scores than the CNN model in both the training and test phases. This suggests that the Restnet model is performing better overall based on the provided scores.
